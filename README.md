# Text-Speech-Convertor
This project is a simple Text to Voice Converter web app that uses the built-in Web Speech API (speechSynthesis) — no external APIs or libraries needed!

✨ Features

  🎙️ Choose from multiple available system voices (male, female, accents)
  
  ⚡ Works entirely offline in supported browsers
  
  🖌️ Clean and responsive design
  
  🗣️ Just type and click "Speak" – that’s it!
  

🧪 Technologies Used

  HTML – Structure and layout
  
  CSS – Styling and responsiveness
  
  JavaScript – Voice functionality using the built-in speechSynthesis object
  

🔧 How It Works

  User types or pastes text into a textbox.
  
  A dropdown shows all available voices fetched from the browser.
  
  On clicking the "Listen" button, the selected voice reads the input text aloud.
